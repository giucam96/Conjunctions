# Conjunctions
Excel file containing data on 10,960 conjunction events occurred in 2022 between space objects in Low-Earth Orbit. The dataset is represented as a table, where each row corresponds to a unique conjunction event and each column corresponds to a different feature. The first row of the table reports the columns names. For each conjunction, the following features are provided: the two objects' names ('name_1', 'name_2'), the two objects' Norad numbers ('norad_1', 'norad_2'), a Two-Line Element (TLE) set for each object ('TLE_1', 'TLE_2'), the time difference (in days) between each TLE epoch and the Time of Closest Approach (TCA) ('prop_1', 'prop_2'), the minimum predicted distance at TCA ('min_range') and the corresponding relative velocity ('rel_vel'). To propagate the objects' trajectories and reconstructing the conjunction kinematics, the only necessary features are the two TLE sets and the two propagation time-spans.
